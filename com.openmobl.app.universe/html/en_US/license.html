        <h3 id="section-3.1">3.1. Application of License.</h3>

        <p>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
        governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section
        <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a>. The Source Code version of Covered Code may
        be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of
        this License released under Section <a href="#section-6.1">6.1</a>, and You
        must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
        distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
        version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or
        the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional
        document offering the additional rights described in Section <a href=
        "#section-3.5">3.5</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="section-3.2">3.2. Availability of Source Code.</h3>

        <p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
        made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either
        on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
        Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
        available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
        must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
        initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
        version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
        recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
        remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
        maintained by a third party.</p>

        <h3 id="section-3.3">3.3. Description of Modifications.</h3>

        <p>You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
        file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the
        date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
        Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
        provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
        Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
        version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
        ownership of the Covered Code.</p>

        <h3 id="section-3.4">3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</h3>

        <h4 id="section-3.4-a">(a) Third Party Claims</h4>

        <p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
        intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by
        such Contributor under Sections <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> or <a href=
        "#section-2.2">2.2</a>, Contributor must include a text file with the
        Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
        party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom
        to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is
        made available as described in Section <a href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>,
        Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor
        makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
        appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform
        those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been
        obtained.</p>

        <h4 id="section-3.4-b">(b) Contributor APIs</h4>

        <p>If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
        interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are
        reasonably necessary to implement that <abbr>API</abbr>, Contributor must
        also include this information in the <strong class=
        "very-strong">legal</strong> file.</p>

        <h4 id="section-3.4-c">(c) Representations.</h4>

        <p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4
        (<a href="#section-3.4-a">a</a>) above, Contributor believes that
        Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
        Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
        License.</p>

        <h3 id="section-3.5">3.5. Required Notices.</h3>

        <p>You must duplicate the notice in <a href="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a> in
        each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
        particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include
        such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would
        be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
        Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice
        described in <a href="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a>. You must also duplicate
        this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe
        recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may
        choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
        liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However,
        You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
        Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any
        such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
        alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
        Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
        Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms
        You offer.</p>

        <h3 id="section-3.6">3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</h3>

        <p>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
        requirements of Sections <a href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>, <a href=
        "#section-3.2">3.2</a>, <a href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>, <a href=
        "#section-3.4">3.4</a> and <a href="#section-3.5">3.5</a> have been met for
        that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
        version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
        including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations
        of Section <a href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>. The notice must be conspicuously
        included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
        collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered
        Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or
        ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
        different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the
        terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does
        not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code
        version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the
        Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely
        clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
        alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
        indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
        incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
        such terms You offer.</p>

        <h3 id="section-3.7">3.7. Larger Works.</h3>

        <p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
        not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as
        a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of
        this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p>

        <h2 id="section-4">4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or
        Regulation.</h2>

        <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
        License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,
        judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
        this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
        limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in
        the <strong class="very-strong">legal</strong> file described in Section <a
        href="#section-3.4">3.4</a> and must be included with all distributions of
        the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
        such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
        skill to be able to understand it.</p>

        <h2 id="section-5">5. Application of this License.</h2>

        <p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached
        the notice in <a href="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a> and to related Covered

        <h3 id="section-6.1">6.1. New Versions</h3>

        <p>Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
        and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be
        given a distinguishing version number.</p>

        <h3 id="section-6.2">6.2. Effect of New Versions</h3>

        <p>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
        License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version.
        You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any
        subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than
        Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
        created under this License.</p>

        <h3 id="section-6.3">6.3. Derivative Works</h3>

        <p>If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
        only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
        governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
        phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any
        confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note
        that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it
        clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
        Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of
        the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described
        in <a href="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</a> shall not of themselves be deemed to
        be modifications of this License.)</p>

        <p><strong class="very-strong">Covered code is provided under this license
        on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or
        implied, including, without limitation, warranties that the covered code is

        non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
        covered code is with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any
        respect, you (not the initial developer or any other contributor) assume
        the cost of any necessary servicing, repair or correction. This disclaimer
        of warranty constitutes an essential part of this license. No use of any
        covered code is authorized hereunder except under this

        enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
        (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),
        excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which
        at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to

        County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
        without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
        expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
        the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or

        <p>Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as

    <p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                           51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

    <p> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                    <h2>Preamble</h2>

    <p>  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
    the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.

    <p>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.


    <p>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

    <p>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
    rights.

    <p>  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.

    <p>  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.

    <p>  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

    <p>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.

                <h2>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h2>
       <h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h2>

    <p><span class="gnu-number">0. </span> 
    This License applies to any program or other work which contains
    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

    <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

    <p><span class="gnu-number">1. </span>
    You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.

    <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

    <p><span class="gnu-number">2. </span>
    You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
        parties under the terms of this License.

        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

    <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

    <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.

    <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.

    <p><span class="gnu-number">3. </span>

    You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,

        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
        to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with such
        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

    <p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
    itself accompanies the executable.

    <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

    <p><span class="gnu-number">4. </span>
    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.

    <p><span class="gnu-number">5. </span>
    You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Program or works based on it.

    <p><span class="gnu-number">6. </span>
    Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.

    <p><span class="gnu-number">7. </span>
    If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

    <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.

    <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.


    <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.

    <p><span class="gnu-number">8. </span>
    If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

    <p><span class="gnu-number">9. </span>
    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.

    <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
    Foundation.

    <p><span class="gnu-number">10. </span>
    If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                    <h2>NO WARRANTY</h2>

    <p><span class="gnu-number">11. </span>
    BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.


    <p><span class="gnu-number">12. </span>
    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    <p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

            <h2>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h2>

    <p>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

    <p>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <pre>
        &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

        Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.

        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU General Public License for more details.

        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
        with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
        51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
    </pre>

    <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

    <p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
    when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <pre>
        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
    </pre>

    <p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

    <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

    <pre>
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
      `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

      &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
      Ty Coon, President of Vice
    </pre>

    <p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
    Public License instead of this License.
